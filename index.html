            "Elizabeth is an incredible teacher! <br><br>

            She is very supportive, patient, thorough, and customizes everything to my style and abilities. The environment of the lesson is beautiful and comfortable. She is extremely talented and has vast knowledge of music and performance. I started out very nervous and less than beginner, but Elizabeth made me feel at ease right away. At the end of my first lesson, I was already much more knowledgeable and confident. She provides helpful homework for at home practice as well. By my second lesson, I had improved significantly. I am taking regular lessons and look forward to continually growing into my singing abilities!" <br><br>

           "Elizabeth is a consummate professional and has honed her skills with a variety of bands playing many different styles of music. From rock to country to jazz, she can sing in any style and do it very well. Having worked with her in a few different projects, I am very impressed with her ability to perform consistently at a very high level. Her dedication to caring for 'her instrument' also speaks to her level of professionalism. And to top it all off, she's fun to work with!!!" <br><br>

              Elizabeth is extremely professional and incredible!!!!!! I came to my first vocal lesson near petrified and obsessing over the thought that I couldn't sing. I walked out of that session empowered and confident, not only in what I had just learned but in my ability to continue to grow and increasing my capacity. Not only is Elizabeth knowledgeable and talented, but she'll have you giggling the whole way through. <br><br>
